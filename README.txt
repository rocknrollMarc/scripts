A project with some handy scripts that can be used from a bash command line.
Each script should be added to the path by moving it into one of the active bin folders.
An example of such a folder would be /usr/local/bin on most unix system.

Do this as follows on Linux as super user:
# cp scripts/myscript /usr/local/bin
where myscript is the script that you're copying.

Then give executable priviledges:
# chmod +x /usr/local/bin/myscript

You should now be able to execute this in any terminal that you open.

I have a created a folder for each script, or set of scripts.

Have fun!!!
